    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietry requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key. </p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitavle and costly errors with namual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
    <br>
    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the asium group found that large organizations save up to $1600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management.
